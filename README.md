👋 Hi! I'm Mars, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷

💡 I’m passionate about building meaningful solutions that blend tech, growth, and human impact. My sweet spot is helping startups get initial traction, design GTM strategies, and create thriving communities.

🛠️ From orchestrating scrappy go-to-market sprints to building tools and workflows that make founders’ lives easier, I love turning ideas into actionable results.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: early-stage GTM projects, startup growth experiments, community building, and product launches.
💬 Ask me about: GTM strategy, organic growth, community, or how to turn ideas into results.

<3 My happy place is a coffee shop with a latte, a medialuna, and jazz music playing ☕🎶
